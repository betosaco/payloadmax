# MCP to Payload CMS Migration - Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We've created a comprehensive solution for migrating data from the MCP database in Cursor to Payload CMS collections. The solution includes:

1. **Migration Scripts**:
   - `mcp-cursor-migration.js`: The main migration script that uses the MCP query tool to fetch data from the MCP database and migrate it to Payload CMS collections.
   - `run-migration-in-cursor.js`: A simplified script that can be run directly in Cursor AI to seed sample data.

2. **Utility Scripts**:
   - `test-mcp-query.js`: A script to test the MCP query tool and explore the database structure.
   - `mcp-query-template.js`: A template for using the MCP query tool directly in Cursor AI.

3. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation on how to use the migration scripts, troubleshoot issues, and extend the migration.

## Key Features

- **Batch Processing**: The migration processes data in batches to avoid memory issues.
- **ID Mapping**: The migration maintains relationships between entities by mapping original IDs to new IDs.
- **Configurable**: The migration can be controlled using environment variables to enable/disable specific migrations and set batch size.
- **Sample Data Seeding**: If the MCP database is empty, the migration can seed sample data into Payload CMS.
- **Error Handling**: The migration includes robust error handling to ensure the process continues even if individual records fail.
- **Progress Logging**: The migration logs progress and errors for monitoring.

## How to Use

1. **Explore the MCP Database**:
   ```javascript
   // Copy and paste into Cursor AI
   mcp__query({ sql: 'SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = \'public\'' });
   ```

2. **Run the Migration**:
   - Option 1: Use the `run-migration-in-cursor.js` script directly in Cursor AI.
   - Option 2: Run the migration from the command line with environment variables:
     ```bash
     SEED_SAMPLE_DATA=true npm run migrate:mcp-cursor
     ```

3. **Extend the Migration**:
   - Add new migration functions to `mcp-cursor-migration.js`.
   - Update the `idMap` object to include new collections.
   - Add function calls to the `main` function.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Migration**: Run the migration with sample data to ensure it works as expected.
2. **Add More Collections**: Extend the migration to include additional collections as needed.
3. **Refine the Sample Data**: Customize the sample data to better match your requirements.
4. **Implement Data Validation**: Add validation to ensure data integrity during migration.
5. **Add Rollback Functionality**: Implement a way to roll back migrations if they fail.

## Conclusion

This migration solution provides a flexible and robust way to migrate data from the MCP database to Payload CMS collections. It can be used as-is or extended to meet specific requirements.
